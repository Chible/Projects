A Collection of my Projects

Toadventure: A 2D adventure combat game where you play as a toad who is looking to reclaim his forest from the invading insects
I fully developed this game in collaboration with just one classmate. Was developed in GameMaker using git source control. Final version is still in-progress. Current version has movement, collisions, gravity, sprites and animations, and a basic tongue that can be controlled with the mouse

Socket JFrames: A local program that connects basic Painter GUIâ€™s and allows them to share illustrations and chat with each other
Program was developed in Java with sockets and threads. I was the only contributor to this project.
